    <h1>Is it secure?</h1>
    <p>
        At no point should anyone be able to get anything identifiable from the site.
        I use accounts to prevent abuse, but other than that I avoid storing any personal information.
        The EXIF info on the images should be washed out, and the location is manually input by you.
