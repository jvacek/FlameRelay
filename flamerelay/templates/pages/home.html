        It's a fun project to track a lighter's journey across the world. Here's how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        🔍 Find a lighter and see where it's been
        <br>
        📍 Submit a photo with a location and a little message
        <br>
        🤲 Pass it on to a stranger or a friend
        <br>
        📩 Get an update when it's found again (if you want).
